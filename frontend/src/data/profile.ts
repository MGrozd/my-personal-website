    title: `About Me`,
    professionalSummary: `I am a dedicated Python developer and full-stack developer with comprehensive experience in backend systems, 
        web applications, and C++ game development. Among my most notable accomplishments is the independent design 
        and implementation of a robust user permission mechanism using the FastAPI framework. I have a strong passion 
        for automation—whether it involves generating reports, exporting data, or streamlining deployment processes, 
        I take pride in developing scripts that enhance efficiency and reduce the potential for errors. I am recognized 
        for delivering complex features, elevating code quality, mentoring colleagues, and consistently contributing a 
        positive and solution-oriented mindset to every team I work with. Adaptable, self-driven, and committed to 
        continuous learning, I strive to add value in every project I undertake.`,
